###### 1. If the output of a model is given by $y=f(\mathbf{x};W)$, then which of the following choices for $f$ are most appropriate when the task is binary classification?

**A - Logistic sigmoid**

**B - Linear**

C - Binary threshould

**D - Linear threshold**


###### 2. After learning using the Perceptron algorithm, how easy is it to express the learned weight vector in terms of the input vectors and the initial weight vector? Assume the input vectors have real-valued components.


A - It requires real numbers.

B - It is impossible.

**C - It requires only one integer per training case.**

**D - It requires one bit per training case.**


###### 3. Suppose we are given three data points...

**A: sqrt(2)**

###### 4. Suppose that we have a perceptron with weight vector w and we create a new set of weights w∗=cw by scaling w by some positive constant c. 

**A: False**

###### 5. Suppose that we have a perceptron with weight vector w and we create a new set of weights w∗=w+c by adding some constant vector c to w. Assume that the bias is zero.

**A: True**

###### 6. Suppose we are given four training cases:...

**A - Make the third value of each input vector be the same as the target value for that input vector.** 

**B - Make the third value be 1 for one of the four input vectors and 0 for the other three.**

C - Make the third value of each input vector be the opposite of the first value (i.e. use 1 if the first value is 0 and 0 if the first value is 1)

D - Make the third value of each input vector be the same as the first value.


###### 7. Brian wants to use a neural network to predict the price of a stock tomorrow given today's price and the price over the last 10 days. The inputs to this network are price over the last 10 days and the output is tomorrow's price. The hidden units in this network receive information from the layer below, transmit information to the layer above and do not send information within the same layer. Is this an example of a feed-forward network or a recurrent network?

**A: Feed-Foward**

###### 8. Brian and Andy are having an argument about the perceptron algorithm. They have a dataset that the perceptron cannot seem to classify (that is, it fails to converge to a solution). Andy reasons that if he could collect more examples, that might solve the problem by making the data set linearly separable and then the perceptron algorithm will converge. Brian claims that collecting more examples will not help. Which one of them is correct?

**A: Brian**
